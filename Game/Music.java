package Game;


/**
 * An object of this class represents a signle soundtrack.
 * 
 * Constructor - receives parameters specifying window dimensions, etc.
 * 
 * The JComponent class has a paint method - this does NOT update in real time,
 * only when you move the window. (I think). Create a test setup and make sure
 * you can RUN IT AT 60 FPS. Also, the drawing will be outsourced to the game
 * class.
 * 
 * WHAT DO WE WANT:
 * We want to have a canvas that we can update at will, 60 times per second. We
 * can draw to the canvas as much as we want, and it will update the screen when
 * we tell it to, and will clear the screen when we want it to.
 * WE DO NOT WANT A PAINT METHOD. We don't want to draw all the graphics when
 * Java wants us to, we want to draw it when its convenient for us. That is how
 * most renderers work, including the default one from the OS so it must be
 * possible in Java.
